#### Bank Application REST API

This project is a simple REST API for a bank application built to demonstrate basic CRUD operations.
The application allows users to:

- Create a bank account
- Get account details
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Get all accounts
- Delete an account

This project focuses only on core REST API functionality.
There is no authentication or JWT implemented. It is purely for learning and practicing CRUD operations in a RESTful application.
